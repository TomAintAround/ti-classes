# TI Classes

Here you can find every exercise that I did in my university course Tecnologias da Inform√°tica (Computer Technology). My university is in Portugal, so expect the code and comments to be in portuguese.

To run this, you will need an Arduino Uno. I frankly didn't publish here the diagrams of the circuits, so many of these exercises may be unreproducible.
